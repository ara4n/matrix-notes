# betz

[betz] runs the <https://hackerspaces.be/> matrix server and has this
week, inbetween repairing his Synapse install, been working on a project called
[matrixboard]. This tool is used to output the last five messages from a given
room to displayed as HTML, the idea being to display output from a specific room
as a website widget. You can see an example using [#matrix-dev]
[here](http://matrix.hackerspaces.be:1337/!XqBunHwQIXUiqCaoxq:matrix.org?color=green).

# mtxclient

Big progress from [mujx], developer of the [nheko] client on his
project [mtxclient].
[As of this week](https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient/commit/7e522df71c804cbc04f38007c3958ebbb56815d3),
mxtclient is able to decrypt group events. When writing (that is, sending
encrypted messages) is complete, the idea is to migrate this work back to nheko,
though mujx points out this library could be used in any client.
