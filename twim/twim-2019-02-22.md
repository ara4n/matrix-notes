## nheko_reborn roadmap

[red_sky] has continued to work on nheko, and shared a general roadmap in [#nheko-reborn:matrix.org]:

> The remainder of 0.6.x is expected to be bug fixes. This includes bug fixes in mtxclient as well as nheko.  
> 0.7.0 will be the next feature release. The end goal here is to add some of the capabilities that people have been requesting, and other things that people haven't been requesting.  
> AFTER 0.7.0 releases, I will then focus on updating the encryption to include more thn just text mesages.

## uMatriks planning

[mariogrip] [announced his plans for going ahead](https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks/issues/71) with [uMatriks]:

> * Clean up c++ code
> * Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed
> * Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, wedo this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code
> * Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui
> * Offload heavy js logic to c++
> * Cleaner UI, with less crust
> * Async everything
> * Merge our WIP call support
> * Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)
> * Slowly start moving to QQC2
> * Implement reply
> * Implement sending of media
