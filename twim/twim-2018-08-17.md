# This Week in Matrix 2018-08-17

## Riot Translations

[@csybr:dodsorf.as] and [@dandellion:dodsorf.as] appeared and announced that there is now a Norwegian Nynorsk translation available for both [riot-web] and [matrix-react-sdk].  
Non-Matrix-related aside: as a lazy Brit, I was vaguely aware of the cultural weight language carries in the history of Scandinavia, but didn't realise that [Norway still has some fundamental differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language#Bokm%C3%A5l_and_Nynorsk) ongoing.

## Seaglass builds being generated

[Seaglass], the MacOS-native client, now has [automatically generated builds available on bintray](https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass#files).

## Ruby SDK v0.0.3

[Ananace] has tagged and released the next development version of the Ruby SDK - 0.0.3. He has plans to "finish up documentation and unit testing", with the aim of making a v1.0.0 release.

## Matrix support now in ntfy

[Half-Shot] took a rare 30-minute window away from bridge maintenance to add Matrix support to [ntfy]. ntfy describes itself as

> A utility for sending notifications, on demand and when commands finish

but in fact, you also send notifications whenever you like by calling `ntfy send` from anywhere you'd normally execute shell commands. This will make it really easy to integrate Matrix notifications into any other application!

## Quarternion

> Quaternion has gained a new way to highlight mentions - with tinted background instead of colored text. Also, the majority of work on rooms grouping is done, and the current master branch features the roomlist grouped by tag (but rooms under each tag are pretty much out of order so it's not really ready for daily use yet).

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

> TWIM: [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) got a lot of improvements lately:\n\n- email-sending support, so that Matrix Synapse can send email notifications (enabled by default)\n\n- [mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd) Identity Server support (enabled by default)\n\n- more detailed [docs](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/README.md) split into various sections (used to be a single README, but with more and more features it was turning into a wall of text)\n\n- started keeping a [changelog](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), especially for backward-incompatible things

## OggCamp

This weekend Neil and I will be representing Matrix at [OggCamp](https://oggcamp.github.io/), "an unconference celebrating Free Culture, Free and Open Source Software, hardware hacking, digital rights, and all manner of collaborative cultural activities"
