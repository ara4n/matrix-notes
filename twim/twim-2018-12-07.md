Purism announced they are sponsoring [Fractal] development, starting with [Julian Sparber] working last month to improve the message view. You can [read about his progress here](https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/). Highlights:

> Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.  
> The part Iâ€™m most excited about is the new "new message divider". When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they donâ€™t need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.  
> I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.  
> In summary, all of these things improve Fractalâ€™s UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.

## Synapse 0.34.0rc1

[0.34.0rc1 is out](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0rc1) - please test it! 0.34.0 will be the first to officially support python 3. We're still working on the debian packaging but 0.34.0 proper should be out next week.

## Dendrite

[Brendan] has been getting on with Dendrite development:

> Started auditing Dendriteâ€™s codebase to identify what is left to implement, along with what hasnâ€™t been implemented correctly. Still a lot of work left to do on this, but itâ€™s looking promising so far.

## Modular

Modular is a Hosted Homeservers product, check out [modular.im]. This week:

> Matrix -> Matrix account migration tool available at <https://www.modular.im/tools/matrix-migration>. It's still beta, so please test it and let us know if you experience issues.

## New Homeserver: [linuxgaming.life]

[swedneck] has set up a new public homeserver at [linuxgaming.life]! There is also a Riot installation at <https://riot.linuxgaming.life>, served via IPFS.

> Currently working on the website (based on [t2bot.io], thank you [travis][TravisR] for making that [available on github](https://github.com/t2bot/t2bot.io)!) and making things nicer in general.  
> I will be adding more bots shortly. Please let [me][swedneck] know of any issues with the HS or anything surrounding it.

## Informo

[Informo] is a project to create a specification and implementation for distributing information and news. This week they have been working on merging changes to the specification:

> Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including [SCS #9](https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9) (rendered [here](https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/)) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and [SCS #11](https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11) (rendered [here](https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/)) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ðŸ™‚  
> There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.

## Minecraft Bridge

[Dandellion]:

> I started working on a Minecraft bridge pretty heavily based on Travis's old project, but using Minecraft-protocol instead of mineflayer.  
> You need a bot Minecraft account that can join and idle in the server, it then uses /tellraw to post messages.

## Spectral

[Qt 5.12 LTS was released yesterday](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/12/06/qt-5-12-lts-released/), and [Black Hat] is eager to get it integrated with [Spectral]:

> As Qt 5.12 was released a few hours ago, I am porting Spectral from 5.11 to 5.12. It will utilize QtQuick's new DelegateChooser to bring a faster timeline. Lots of code refactoring and cleaning are also going on.  
> I plan to drop Qt 5.11 support as soon as Qt 5.12 gets into major GNU/Linux distributions' repositories.

## libQMatrixClient 0.4.1 released

[libQMatrixClient], which powers [Spectral] and [Quaternion] was released by [kitsune], Lazy Loading coming soon:

> libQMatrixClient 0.4.1 has been released today, with small fixes in the stable branch. Meanwhile, active work is ongoing on lazy-loading support in the library, with ETA for the feature landing in master being in about a week or so.

## Riot Web

* Redesign progress: all resizeable sections are now persisted, (slow) progress on improving read markers
* [Communities and community invitations should be more resilient to errors](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2326) (on /develop only so far)

## Riot iOS

* Reskin still ongoing
* A new release is coming
* Less activity because of POSS

## Riot Android

* A new developer joined us to help maintaining Riot: Valere Fedronic
* Keys backup PR in review
* Privacy Terms acceptance in login flow in review
* FCM issue investigation/troubleshooting by Valere
* FranÃ§ois Off (sick :()
* New theme is coming soon

## Koma

[druig] has been working on [Koma], a JavaFX Matrix client:

> This week in koma: implementation of json library switched from runtime reflection to compile-time code generation  
> The matrix api is implemented manually in the project, retrofit and moshi are used to interact with the rest api.

## SimpleMatrix

As we mentioned in TWIM last week, [MTRNord] has been working on designs for [SimpleMatrix], a Matrix client for Android in development. This week he has made a video showcasing the new design.

## Redecentralize meetup in London

Last night Half-Shot & Neil & Brendan went to see the [Redecentralize] folk at their meetup:

> Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize  
> We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, [new-riot](https://riot.im/experimental/) and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.

<small>
Note for the confused: the *format of the meetup* was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating. If you do find [such a use for Matrix](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-wishlist/issues/108), come tell us in [#twim:matrix.org].

## matrix-wug, X-SAMPA to IPA bot

[Last month](https://matrix.org/blog/2018/11/09/this-week-in-matrix-2018-11-09/#xsampatoipabot) [Dandellion] introduced a bot designed to convert between formats for pronunciation notation, this week he released the source code: <https://github.com/dali99/matrix-wug>

## The end of the post, and nearly the end of 2018

This week it has been winter-in-Europe kind of weather, but that's ok, it happens every year. TWIM on the other hand happens *every week*, so if you have something to share, and would like to share what you've been working on, come chat to us in [#twim:matrix.org].
