## Spec Status and requests

The Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from [TravisR], [Cadair] and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the [proposals list](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals) to stay up to date, or straight to the [matrix-doc] repo and [#matrix-spec:matrix.org] room to get the raw activity.

* richvdh is requesting feedback on [MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425). **Please read and give feedback, as the intention is to start working on this as soon as next week.**
* erik TODO
* Discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: [MSC1426](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426) and [MSC1421](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421)

## nheko 0.5.x

[nheko] 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from [bintray.com](https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/). I've been using it for the last week or so (on OSX) and found it very stable and usable. [mujx] commented that "highlights were encryption support & desktop notifications on all platforms", but you can get much more thorough notes from the [release notes](https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases).

## Plasma

It's been several weeks since we mentioned [Plasma], but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead [Nico] said recently:

> I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. `createRoom` and `invite` C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.

You can find the full list of implemented endpoints [in the readme](https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md), and also read the [architecture overview](https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md).

## kitsune, live on stage

[kitsune] presented an introduction to Matrix (for a technical audience) at the Tokyo Linux Users Group.

## GTAD pulls in description and summary fields from the API

[kitsune] continues working on [GTAD], and this week has started automatically including docs in [libQMatrixClient]:

> GTAD is now aware of description and summary fields in API descriptions so you can use them with Javadoc/Doxygen. As a result, libQMatrixClient master branch now enjoys doc-comments throughout its CS API layer - the rest of the library builds in envy.

## mautrix-telegram

[tulir]:

> [mautrix-telegram] now has a [provisioning API](https://spec.maunium.net/mxtg-provisioning/), meaning integration managers like [Dimension] can make an auth/portal management interface for the bridge

In an immediate response, [TravisR], creator of [Dimension] confirmed:

> Soon in matrix: Dimension will have support for that provisioning API

## SimpleMatrix

[MTRNord] introduced us to [SimpleMatrix](https://git.nordgedanken.de/Nordgedanken/SimpleMatrix):

> SimpleMatrix is my approach on making an Android App that is more easy to use than the official one in Terms of UX and UI. Planned is also a Android Wear App within this App for mostly Notifications.

SimpleMatrix is planning to use [matrix-java-sdk], but for now is a visual mockup, it doesn't currently connect to Matrix.

## Tales of [Half-Shot] and his many Bridges

### Arrival of the Discord DMs

> After lots of begging, frustration and eventually an offer of a free lunch (thanks [Anoa]): I give you Discord DMs.  
> This first cut bridges over existing regular and group DMs to Matrix.  In the future we will also allow you to create DMs from Matrix so that you can contact users without even logging into Discord. With thanks to the [#discord:half-shot.uk] community for helping shape this feature!
>
> Currently this is in PR form but is very likely to make it into the 0.3 release of [matrix-appservice-discord].

### Half-Shot fixes the Foonetic IRC bridge

For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, [Half-Shot] is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.
