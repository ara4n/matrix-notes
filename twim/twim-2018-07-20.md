## SimpleMatrix

[MTRNord] introduced us to [SimpleMatrix](https://git.nordgedanken.de/Nordgedanken/SimpleMatrix):

> SimpleMatrix is my approach on making an Android App that is more easy to use than the official one in Terms of UX and UI. Planned is also a Android Wear App within this App for mostly Notifications.

SimpleMatrix is planning to use [matrix-java-sdk], but for now is a visual mockup, it doesn't currently connect to Matrix.

Room: [#SimpleMatrix:matrix.ffslfl.net](https://matrix.to/#/#SimpleMatrix:matrix.ffslfl.net)  
Git: <https://git.nordgedanken.de/Nordgedanken/SimpleMatrix>

## Plasma

It's been several weeks since we mentioned [Plasma], but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead [Nico] said recently:

> I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. `createRoom` and `invite` C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.

You can find the full list of implemented endpoints [in the readme](https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md).

## Half-shot fixes the Foonetic IRC bridge

For those who (want to) use [Foonetic] IRC channels, [Half-Shot] is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.

## GTAD pulls in description and summary fields from the API

[kitsune] continues working on [GTAD], and this week has started automatically including docs in [libQMatrixClient]:

> GTAD is now aware of description and summary fields in API descriptions so you can use them with Javadoc/Doxygen. As a result, libQMatrixClient master branch now enjoys doc-comments throughout its CS API layer - the rest of the library builds in envy.

## nheko 0.5.x

[nheko] 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from [bintray.com](https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/). I've been using it for the last week or so (on OSX) and found it very stable and usable. [mujx] commented that "highlights were encryption support & desktop notifications on all platforms", but you can get much more thorough notes from the [release notes](https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases).
