## Welcome

Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!

## koma

Announcing his update nearly a week ago, [radicus] released [v0.7.3](https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3) of [koma].

> There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:
> * Upgrade to JavaFx 9
> * Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list
> * Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size

## dialogflow connector

[vurpo] has released [matrix-dialogflow](https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow), which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:

> I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.

## mautrix-telegram

[tulir]:

> New stuff in mautrix-telegram:
> * A basic telematrix database import script
> * Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
> I've also been planning an improved Matrix->Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.

## jmsdk

[ma1uta] has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented [jmsdk](https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk), a "very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, ...)"

>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API.  It still under development and contains bugs.

He has also been working on a "bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices."

## [matrix-appservice-voip]

[Max] has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:

>We have successfull VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.
>
> Next steps:
> * more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)
> * SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially
> * [mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd) integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users
> * [mxgwd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd) integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so > calls are directly seen
> * And much more in later releases
>

## transform

A wild [bettiah] appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:

> I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <https://github.com/bettiah/transform> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.

I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the [readme](https://github.com/bettiah/transform):

> Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
> **Status:** Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite & Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
> **Design:** A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
> **Contributing**: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe & rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.

## dsn-traveller source code released!

Good news for those following the progress of [dsn-traveller], the source is now publicly available!

From [Florian]:

> I received permission to publish the source code of the DSN Traveller bot (<https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/>) prior to handing in my thesis: You can find it at <https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller>, it's written with [ruma-client] and Rust async/await.

Room remains at [#dsn-traveller:dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu].

## E2E for Python SDK

Late breaking, but not itself broken, [&Adam] has news from [matrix-python-sdk]:

> first olm-centered E2E PR for the python sdk merged to master (finally). Lots of great work from Zil0 still to be merged waiting on PR review. <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pull/224>
