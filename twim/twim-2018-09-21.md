## Matrique is now Spectral

After intense discussion, there is a new name for Matrique: **Spectral**. The repo now sites at <https://gitlab.com/b0/spectral>, there is a new room at [#spectral:encom.eu.org], and a new logo:

## Matrix Corporal

[@slavi:devture.com], creator of [Matrix Corporal] (a Matrix server configuration tool - "Kubernetes for Matrix"):

> [Matrix Corporal](https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal) has received [some updates](https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/blob/2c65b573261cc19c3a0a1cb10168257b953200e8/CHANGELOG.md) over the past few weeks since its initial release: a couple of additional HTTP APIs for retrieving/destroying user access tokens; more consistency with the Matrix Client-Server specification when it comes to error responses; faster reconciliation for user accounts that are joined to many/large rooms.

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

Another project from [@slavi:devture.com], for those who prefer their DevOps ansible-flavoured:

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy] now also helps you [set up service discovery](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-well-known.md) as per the [.well-known Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#server-discovery).

## VoIP signalling support has landed in libQMatrixClient

Exciting times for [libQMatrixClient]!! Thanks [kitsune], developer of libQMatrixClient and [Quaternion]:

> After some pretty long time of being in a PR/fork, VoIP signalling support has landed in libQMatrixClient! Many thanks to mariogrip (the founder of UBports) for the initial code and to delijati (a developer behind [uMatriks]) for getting it to work with the most recent library.  
> The actual VoIP stack does not come included, client developers have to take whatever WebRTC implementation is available for their platform and glue the pieces together. However, as the example of uMatriks shows, this now becomes relatively easy if your platform is on good terms with WebRTC (like UBports). I look forward to further work with UBports community on keeping this platform a first-class Matrix citizen.

Go chat in [#quaternion:matrix.org] to see the ways libQMatrixClient is developing.

## jcg ansible PR for matrix notifications

[jcg] has an [upstream PR to have matrix notifications in ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45823). Combined with Slavi's [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy] above, you can get Matrix notifications about issues with your Matrix deployment...

## Seaglass E2E + self-update + other credit

Seaglass end-to-end encryption support is now complete (until Matthew moves the goalposts again ðŸ˜Š) including device verification and blacklisting, key sharing requests, key import and export (which should be compatible with Riot) and re-requesting keys

## Jeon

Massive update from [ma1uta] about his [Jeon] project! This update brings Jeon into line with the most recent updates to the Client-Server, Application Service, Push and Identity APIs.

In ma1uta's words:

> Jeon is a set of the java interfaces and classes which describes the Matrix API.
> 
> * client-api: r0.4.0-1 corresponds to the r0.4.0 C2S API.
> * application-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponse to the r0.1.0 AS API,
> * push-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 PUSH API,
> * identity-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 IS API.\nAll artefacts available from the Maven Central Repository.\nMajor changes:
> * Full support for the corresponding Matrix api.
> * Changed version for displaying the Matrix api version.
> * Added support to the asynchronous responses.
> 
> Also updated the swagger schemas generated from the code:
> * <https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/c2s.json> - C2S API
> * <https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/as.json> - AS API
> * <https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/push.json> - PUSH API
> * <https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/id.json> - IS API

> And the first hotfix: application-api r0.1.0-2 with fixed url (/transactions has been changes to the _matrix/app/v1/transactions). And this release will break all AS because synapse sends transactions to the old url.

Join [#jeon:matrix.org] to discuss the progress of this product more.

## ma1uta jmsdk

[ma1uta] must have been in a work-on-Matrix mode this week, because he has also updated [jmsdk]:

> I have released a new version of the java client (https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk/tree/master/client-sdk). The new client works is asynchronous mode, each method doesn't block the thread and return the CompletableFuture (promise in java). Then you can block thread to get the response or build a asynchronous promises chain.

## Made for Matrix badge ??

hi all: we're experimenting with variations on the 'Made for Matrix' logo intended to be used as a recognisable way for apps/bots/bridges/servers etc to declare they implement Matrix. I know this is a bit off topic, but if folks could give feedback on https://goo.gl/forms/uJMsQL1dhyVXdTqH3 it'd be appreciated!
