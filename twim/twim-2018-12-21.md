# This Week in Matrix 2018-12-21

## Kamax hosting

## t2bot.io upgrade

[TravisR]:

> Just a head's up that I've increased the storage capacity of the database. With current projections, the server should be good for another year or two.
>
> The database is also 1ms closer to Synapse and has a faster CPU in it. It probably won't make a dent in speed on federation, but it is a step forward.
>
> I'll be rolling out python 3 to the homeserver this week too, which should help a little bit.
