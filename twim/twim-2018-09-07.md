# This Week in Matrix 2018-09-07

## Bridges

### XMPP

Are you in the market for a Matrix-XMPP bridge? When I say "market", I mean it because this week we have *two* announcements for bridging to XMPP! You can choose whether you'd prefer your bridge to be implemented as a puppet, or a bot.

[Ma1uta] has a new version of [his Matrix-Xmpp bridge](https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge)

> It is a double-puppet bridge which can connects the Matrix and Xmpp ecosystems. Just invite the `_xmpp_master:ru-matrix.org` and tell him: `_xmpp_master: connect test@conference.jabber.org` to connect current room with the specified conference.  
> You can ask about this bridge in the #matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org  room.  
> Current supports only conferences and only `m.text` messages. 1:1 conversations and other message types will be later.

[maze](@maze:strahlungsfrei.de) appeared this weed and announced [MxBridge](https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge), a new Matrix-XMPP bridge.

> It works as a bot, so it is non-puppeting. Rooms can be mapped dynamically by the bot administrator(s). There is no support for 1-1 chats (yet). MxBridge is written as a multi-process application in Elixir and it should scale quite well (but don't tie me down on it ;)). <https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge>

## Home servers

Jason has been working heavily on Construct, and has new test users!  
Construct is able to federate with Synapse and the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  
[mujx] has created a docker for Construct which streamlines its deployment.

> Construct development is still occurring here <https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis> but we are now significantly closer to pushing the first release to <https://github.com/matrix-construct>. Also feel free to stop by in [#test:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net) / [#zemos-test:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org) as well -- a room hosted by Construct, of course.

> [tulir] has now deployed using the standalone install instructions on a very small LXC VM using ZFS. Unfortunately ZFS does not support O_DIRECT (direct disk IO) which is how Construct achieves maximum performance using concurrent reads. This is not a problem though when using an SSD or for personal deployments. I'll be posting more about how Construct hacked RocksDB to use direct IO, which can get the most out of your hardware with multiple requests in-flight (even with an SSD).

## Matrix Python SDK needs a maintainer

We should say a huge **Thank You** to [&Adam] for his work leading the Python SDK over the previous months! Unfortunately due to a busy home life (congratulations on the second child!) he has decided to step down as lead maintainer. Anyone interested in this project should head to <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/279>, and also come and chat in [#matrix-python-sdk:matrix.org].

## kitsune on Hokkaido island

> I ended up being on Hokkaido island right when a major earthquake struck it; so no activity on Matrix from me in the nearest couple of days. Also, donations to [GlobalGiving for the disaster relief are welcome](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/flood-and-landslide-relief-in-japan-we-need-you/) because people are really struggling here (abusing the communication channel, sorry).
