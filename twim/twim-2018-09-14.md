### Seaglass

Seaglass has had a substantial rewrite to the room cache to help improve reliability and reduce crashes, better thumbnail behaviour on inline images, various tiny visual tweaks, in-window blending, support for encryption key sharing requests for E2E rooms. Other than that this week has mostly featured lots and lots of bug fixes, hopefully lots of crashes fixed.

Screenshot below shows the new E2E UI:

> There's now a second matrix client available in F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lavadip.miniVector/ (link live hopefully soon, itâ€™s already installable from the client).
>
>This is a fork of Riot Android done by hrjet, f-droid release done by me. It's removing mostly jitsi group call functionality and some other smaller stuff. In doing so it manages to require far less permissions and is also only 12 MB in size instead of riots 20 MB.

### Matrique

[Black Hat]:

> Matrique gained alpha support for multiple accounts.

## Construct homeserver progress

This week:

> Added notification counts which show up in Riot now, and expanded support for g++-7 and 8 instead of just g++-6. Construct repository is found at: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct>.
