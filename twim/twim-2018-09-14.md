### Seaglass

[Neil][neilalexander] has been keeping up the pace with [Seaglass] development:

> Seaglass has had a substantial rewrite to the room cache to help improve reliability and reduce crashes, better thumbnail behaviour on inline images, various tiny visual tweaks, in-window blending, support for encryption key sharing requests for E2E rooms.
>
> Rendering performance has been massively increased (if you ignore the occasional bug). Resizing the window shouldn't be so slow anymore and a lot of avatar image operations are no longer repeated unnecessarily
>
> Other than that this week has mostly featured lots and lots of bug fixes, hopefully lots of crashes fixed.

Screenshot below shows the new E2E UI:

### Quaternion

When not escaping typhoons, [kitsune] has found some time to continue work on Quaternion:

> [Quaternion]'s master branch is alive again - it's been prone to crashes in the last two weeks, now it shouldn't. Feel free to try the new room list organised by tag!

### SimpleMatrix

[MTRNord]:

> [SimpleMatrix] now supports Basic messages sending (with Commonmark) and basic recieving of messages.

### miniVector

[Marcus](https://matrix.to/#/@bubuiic:matrix.org)

> There's now a second matrix client available in F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lavadip.miniVector/ (link live hopefully soon, itâ€™s already installable from the client).
>
>This is a fork of Riot Android done by hrjet, f-droid release done by me. It's removing mostly jitsi group call functionality and some other smaller stuff. In doing so it manages to require far less permissions and is also only 12 MB in size instead of riots 20 MB.

### Matrique

[Black Hat]:

> Matrique gained alpha support for multiple accounts.

### libQMatrixClient ecosystem

As you may know, [Matrique], led by [Black Hat], and [Quaternion], led by [kitsune], are both projects build using [libQMatrixClient], a Qt5 library from [kitsune] designed for writing Matrix clients. While [kitsune] has been working on the library for some time, [Black Hat] has also now
started making contributions:

> libQMatrixClient now has a pkg-config file to further ease clients building on Linux systems, as well as more convenient API to track read markers if all users, not just of the local one.

## Construct homeserver progress

This week:

> Added notification counts which show up in Riot now, and expanded support for g++-7 and 8 instead of just g++-6. Construct repository is found at: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct>.

## IRC Connection Tracker

[Half-Shot]'s is continuing to work on the bridge

The project is going quite well, and is going to be used on matrix.org once production ready which will really speed up upgrades and give us near zero downtime indifferent to the size of the bridge.

At the moment the project has the ability to spin up and maintain connections, however the connections are not supporting IRC fully yet as there are bits to do on the parsing and maintaining state side. There is also work on a top-like tool to visualise and control the service outside of the bridge so we can quickly handle any oddities if they come up. Finally, it allows you to hot reload the configuration without dropping existing connections!

On the work done to support this on matrix-appservice-bridge, there is basic support for stating connections on the bridge but it's in early stages at the moment.



## #matrix-dev

[#matrix-dev:matrix.org] was reborn as a new room a couple of weeks ago, but maybe not everyone knows. Come join [#matrix-dev:matrix.org], it's a starting point for all developers looking to build on the platform.
