It's over. It's once again safe to check your email, and we got some fairly good jokes out of the experience.

# matrix-docker-ansible-deploy can now set up your homeserver using the official Matrix Synapse Docker image

[@slavi:devture.com] sent great news: [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy] can now set up your homeserver using the official [Matrix Synapse Docker] image. In his words:

> Using this Ansible playbook is probably the easiest way to set up a fully-functioning Matrix homeserver on your own machine. The setup includes Matrix Synapse and some related services required to actually make it useful (automatically-managed HTTPS; STUN/TURN server for audio/video calls; Postgres database for Synapse; optionally riot-web; optionally Amazon S3 storage support)

# New Riot theme from MTRNord: blueshine

[MTRNord] has started work on "a secondary Dark Riot Theme named blueshine". Lots of [screenshots are available on the PR](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/6816), and take a look below too. If you'd like to try it out, [TravisR] has hosted a [Riot instance with the theme included here](https://t2bot.io/blueshine/).

# nheko SUSE packaging

It's now possible to install [nheko] as a [SUSE package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nheko) - great to see that there is enough demand for a community package to appear.

# Julian Sparber post

[Julian](https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org) is a [GSOC] student working on [Fractal]. He's been working to improve the user account setting panel, and has made progress [as described here](https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/05/28/fractal-gsoc-progress/).
> The user can now change the following settings: Avatar, display name, add and remove email addresses and phone numbers. Also, they can see the homeserver and their own MXID.
> We will probably make some more small changes on the way to make the UX as good as we possibly can.
