# matrix-docker-ansible-deploy can now set up your homeserver using the official Matrix Synapse Docker image

[@slavi:devture.com] sent great news: [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy] can now set up your homeserver using the official [Matrix Synapse Docker] image. In his words:

> Using this Ansible playbook is probably the easiest way to set up a fully-functioning Matrix homeserver on your own machine. The setup includes Matrix Synapse and some related services required to actually make it useful (automatically-managed HTTPS; STUN/TURN server for audio/video calls; Postgres database for Synapse; optionally riot-web; optionally Amazon S3 storage support)

# Interactive Key Verification: Spec proposal from uhoreg

Long-time contributor [uhoreg] joined the matrix.org core team this week, and is requesting feedback on a spec proposal relating to [Interative Key Verification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SXmyjyNqClJ5bTHtwvp8tT1Db4pjlGVxfPQNdlQILqU/).

# Fedora Magazine mention of Fractal

[Fractal] was [featured in Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/fractal-gnome-matrix-chat-client/) this week, just a little introduction. I notice the article barely introduces matrix: not sure if that's an oversight or a belief that the audience will already know it!

# Riot Jouni blog post

[Riot] is undergoing a visual redesign, thanks to [Jouni Helminen](http://helminen.co/). Take a look at [the redesign work on the Riot blog](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782). The changes are not radical, but will help standardise and modernise the Riot interface. Early feedback I've seen has been mostly positive.

# New Riot theme from MTRNord: blueshine

[MTRNord] has started work on "a secondary Dark Riot Theme named blueshine". Lots of [screenshots are available on the PR](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/6816), and take a look below too. If you'd like to try it out, [TravisR] has hosted a [Riot instance with the theme included here](https://t2bot.io/blueshine/).

# nheko SUSE packaging

It's now possible to install [nheko] as a [SUSE package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nheko) - great to see that there is enough demand for a community package to appear.

# Julian Sparber post

[Julian](https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org) is a [GSOC] student working on [Fractal]. He's been working to improve the user account setting panel, and has made progress [as described here](https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/05/28/fractal-gsoc-progress/).
> The user can now change the following settings: Avatar, display name, add and remove email addresses and phone numbers. Also, they can see the homeserver and their own MXID.
> We will probably make some more small changes on the way to make the UX as good as we possibly can.

# matrix-registration

Helpfully named [Zeratax?utf8=✓] has released [matrix-registration](https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration), an application which allows you to "easily create tokens to invite users on your homeserver without the need to open up public registration". There is a public demo here: <https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html>

Says [Zeratax][Zeratax?utf8=✓]:
> my personal problem was:
> i didn't want to open up registration for everyone
> i didn't want to register every account manually and have to worry about seeing passwords etc
> now i can just share a link, e.g:
> https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html?token=JargonGingerYankee
> 
> and my friends can register.
> 
> these token can be restricted as one time usable only or by an expiration date.
