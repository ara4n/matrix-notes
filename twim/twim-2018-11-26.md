# This Week in Matrix 2018-11-26

## Spec & Foundation

* Two workshops happened with the Foundation lawyers to work on [MSC1318] - basically fleshing out a proposal for the details of the foundation governance in terms of how the Guardians (i.e. directors of the foundation board) should interact with the Core Spec Team to act as a back-stop - and working out how to port the MSC (once finished) into formal Articles of Association & adjunct documents.  We’ll get the workshop notes written up as a rewrite of [MSC1318] very shortly.
* New MSCs from vdH on:
    * [MSC1721] Rename m.login.cas to m.login.sso
    * [MSC1730] Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during login
* ...and an alternate to MSC1370: MSC1731 Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during SSO login.
* These three SSO-related MSCs are derived from work being done for a large-scale Matrix deployment for a New Vector customer which we should be able to talk about in future.  Improving SSO and other auth/identity work in Matrix is vital, and needless to say we’re trying to ensure all the resulting work ends up in the spec to the benefit of the whole ecosystem :)

## matrix-media-repo

[TravisR] reports that:

> [matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo) has received a lot of updates in the last few weeks. Although mostly bug fixes and improvements, there's added support for streaming downloads from remote servers. This is mostly useful when someone posts a 100mb video in a room: previously the media repo would download the entire thing then send it over to you. Now it'll send you the video while it also caches it.

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

Big update from [Slavi] this week:

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) has received some updates in the past few weeks - fixing minor bugs, improving documentation, adding support for additional [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse)/[Riot](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web) features, etc.
>
> Most notably (in oldest to most-recent order):
>
> * [Cadair] heard you like playbooks, so he made it possible to [run the playbook from another playbook](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/commit/67e2bf285d44c0cb392ba1e28e615053b748c03c). Thanks Cadair!
> * some [configuration renaming](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-renaming-playbook-variables) to make things more consistent. Most people would likely be unaffected.
> * support has been added for [Postgres 11](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#postgres-11-support). Upgrading is possible and easy (as a related success story, Aaron Raimist shared that he recently upgraded his ~40GB database)
> * [more flexible and more secure-by-default TLS configuration](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ssl-protocols-used-to-serve-riot-and-synapse). Thanks Aaron Raimist!
> * the ability to [customize more parts of riot-web](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#customize-parts-of-riots-config). Thanks Aaron Raimist!
> * [better control over Synapse logging](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ability-to-set-synapse-log-levels). Thanks Aaron Raimist!
> * the ability to [set up a public server](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#support-for-controlling-public-registration-and-room-auto-join) and the ability to make use of Synapse's \"auto-join\" feature. Until now, the playbook was only suited for setting up a private server, but with this, setting up public servers is now a possibility. Thanks [@anadahz](https://github.com/anadahz)
>
> I'm quite happy that the playbook is getting more contributions from others now and is improving in such diverse ways!
>
> Additionally, the [#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com] support room in Matrix is now bridged to the `#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy` IRC Freenode channel, making it easier for people to get support when they don't have a working homeserver.

## libQMatrixClient

[kitsune] has been working on [libQMatrixClient]:

> the work on lazy-loading in [libQMatrixClient] has advanced to the point when client authors may start trying to integrate it in their applications (welcome to [#qmatrixclient:matrix.org] for details - it's a bit rough around the edges yet).

## Spectral

This week [Black Hat] has been working to give [Spectral] a more Material design oriented UI.

## SMSMatrix

[swedneck] reports that:

> [SMSMatrix](https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix) now has a room ([#smsmatrix:matrix.org]). SMSMatrix is a simple bridge between Matrix and SMS, developed by tijder. You install an android app and register a bot account which will invite you to direct chats under the name of anyone who sends you an SMS, which will then act as a normal SMS conversation.

I had a very quick play with this tool and it works great - a good way to quickly bridge SMS to Matrix.

## Riot

News from the [Riot] teams:

* [Android rewrite is continuing in Kotlin](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop) - lots of infrastructure work over  the last few weeks
* E2E key backups landed in Riot/iOS develop (but no UI yet, as we finalise the implementation first on Riot/Web)
* E2E key backups also landed in Riot/Web develop (but with placeholder UI)
* E2E key backups in dev on Riot/Android too (using Realm for storage!)
* Work on the Riot/Web redesign paused for a week due to other commitments but as of Nov 26th we’re back on the case again, making up for lost time.

## Synapse

Most of the focus from the [Synapse] team this week has been on the new version using Python 3:

* Py3 is finished, other than Debian packages - ongoing debate on whether they should use a virtualenv or depend on debian dependencies, and who should maintain them in a Py3 world...
* Lots of running around on final Py3 bugs

## matrix-appservice-purple

[Half-Shot] has continued work on [matrix-appservice-purple].

## Modular

[Modular.im] provides Hosted Homeservers for Matrix.

* Modular now has full support for Custom DNS (letting you point your own SRV records at it)
* Lots of work on a migration tool to allow folks to easily shift Matrix accounts between servers, as well as (in future) migrations from HipChat, Slack & others.
