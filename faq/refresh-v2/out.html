<div class='question'>
<h3>What is Matrix?</h3>
<p>Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.</p>
<p>Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">Client</a>s, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.</p>

<div class='question'>
<h3>What is Matrix's Mission?</h3>
<p>Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.</p>
<p>The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.</p>

<h3>What does this mean for users?</h3>
<p>The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">client</a> app &amp; server you chose, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.</p>

<h3>What kind of company is Matrix.org?</h3>
<p>Matrix.org is an open initiative which acts as a neutral and independent custodian of the Matrix standard. As of Sept 2017 we are finally in the process of incorporating it as a dedicated non-profit entity (most likely a limited by guarantee UK private company called the Matrix.org Foundation).</p>

<h3>How is Matrix.org funded?</h3>
<p>TODO: rewrite to include Status.im.</p>
<p>Matrix.org is currently (Sept 2017) funded by the community, through a
combination of community support (via
<a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>,
<a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a>, Bitcoin and Ethereum),
corporate sponsorship, and grant funding.</p>
<p>Below is ok.</p>
<p>Current Elliptic-level supporters on
Patreon and corporate sponsors can be found on our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/supporters">supporters
page</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to support the core Matrix team as a member of the community, you can do so via:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a></li>
<li>Bitcoin (address: 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE)</li>
<li>Ethereum (address: 0xA5f9a4f9E024F6D727f7afdA9257e22329A97485)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to sponsor the
team as a corporation, or are interested in paying for prioritised or custom
development, please <a href="mailto:matthew@matrix.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>For the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core
contributors worked for <a href="https://www.amdocs.com">Amdocs</a>, who paid for them to
work fulltime on Matrix.  In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be
sufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.
The majority of the core team is now employed by [New Vector]{.definition}, an independent company
set up to hire the team and support Matrix's development.  Other contributors
are funded by their own employers or donate their own time to the project.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<div class='question'>
<h3>Why have you released this as open source?</h3>
<p>We believe that any open standard defining interoperable communication needs to be justified, demonstrated and validated with transparent open source implementations. For Matrix to achieve its mission of making all communications services [interoperable]{.definition} we believe it needs to be truly open, giving people access to take all the code we produce and to use and build on top of it.</p>

</div>
<div class='question'>
<h3>What do you mean by open?</h3>
<p>Matrix is an open standard, meaning that we have freely published the
details for how to communicate [interoperably][interoperable]{.definition} using the Matrix set of
HTTP APIs.  We encourage anyone and everyone to use the APIs and build
their own projects which implement them and so benefit from
interoperability with the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  We also
ensure the standard is not encumbered by any known patent licensing
requirements.</p>
<p>Matrix is also open source, meaning that we have released the source
code of the reference servers, clients and services to the public domain
under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Licence v2</a>, to
encourage anyone and everyone to run their own servers and clients, and
enhance them and contribute their enhancements as they see fit.</p>

<h3>What does federated mean?</h3>
<p>Federation allows separate deployments of a communication service to
communicate with each other - for instance a mail server run by Google
federates with a mail server run by Microsoft when you send email from
@gmail.com to @hotmail.com.</p>
<p>[Federation]{.definition} is different to interoperability, as [interoperable]{.definition} clients
may simply be running on the same deployment - whereas in federation the
deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible manner.</p>
<p>Matrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the internet
can join into the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their own server.</p>

<h3>How is this like e-mail?</h3>
<p>When email was first set up in the early ‘80s, companies like Compuserve
and AT&amp;T and Sprint set up isolated email communities which only allowed
you to exchange mail with users on the same system.  If you got your
email from one service and your friend from another, then you couldn't
message each other.  This is basically the situation we're in today with
VoIP and IM.</p>

<h3>Why has no one done this before?</h3>
<p>There have been several attempts before including [SIP]{.definition}, [XMPP]{.definition} and [RCS]{.definition}.</p>
<p>All of these have had some level of success, but many different
technological/usability/economic factors have ended up limiting their
success.  Unfortunately, we've not ended up in a world where everyone
has a SIP URI or Jabber ID on their business card, or a phone that
actually uses RCS.</p>

<h3>What can I actually do with this?</h3>
<p>A typical <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">client</a> provides a simple chatroom interface to Matrix -
letting the user interact with users and rooms anywhere within the
Matrix [federation]{.definition}.  Text and image messages are supported, and basic
voice-only VoIP calling via WebRTC is supported in one-to-one rooms.
(As of October 2015, experimental multi-way calling is also available
on Riot.im).</p>

<h3>I installed Riot via F-Droid, why is it draining my battery?</h3>
<p>The [F-Droid]{.definition} release of Riot does not use <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/">Google Cloud Messaging</a>. This allows users that do not have or want Google Services installed to use Riot.</p>
<p>The drawback is that Riot has to pull for new messages, which can drain your battery. To counter this, you can change the delay between polls in the settings. Higher delay means better battery life (but may delay receiving messages). You can also disable the background sync entirely (which means that you won't get any notifications at all).</p>
<p>If you don't mind using Google Services, you might be better off installing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.alpha">Google Play store</a> version.</p>

<h3>How do I Matrix-enable my existing app?</h3>
<p>If your app doesn't have any communication capability already, you'll want
to use one of the Matrix [client SDK]{.definition}s to add it in.  These come in different
levels of sophistication - ranging from a simple HTTP API wrapper (like matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or matrix-android-sdk)
through to reusable UI components (like matrix-react-sdk and matrix-ios-kit).
TODO: update this list
Pick the one for your platform, or a 3rd party one if none of the above work for you,
and get plugging it in.  You'll probably also want to read the <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/howtos/client-server.html">Client-Server API
HOWTO</a> too.</p>
<p>If you already have communication infrastructure set up (XMPP, custom HTTP, or whatever),
then you'll want to run a bridge to expose it to the wider Matrix ecosystem.
See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/HOWTO.md">matrix-appservice-bridge HOWTO</a> for a

<h3>What ports do I have to open up to join the global Matrix federation?</h3>
<p>We recommend servers use port 8448 for server&lt;-&gt;server HTTPS traffic.  Look at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse#setting-up-federation">&quot;Setting up Federation&quot;</a> in the Synapse readme file for details.</p>
<p>TODO: I don't fully understand the rest of this section</p>
<p>Client&lt;-&gt;Server traffic can talk directly to Synapse via port 8448, but as by default Synapse creates a self-signed TLS certificate this can cause problems for clients which can't easily trust self-signed certificates (e.g. most web browsers).  Instead, you can proxy access to Synapse's HTTP listener on port 8008 via an existing HTTPS proxy with a valid certificate (e.g. an nginx listening on port 443), or you can point Synapse at a valid X.509 signed TLS certificate.  In future, Synapse will probably use letsencrypt to autogenerate valid certificates rather than self-signed ones during installation, simplifying this process enormously.</p>
<p>You can also put Synapse entirely behind an existing TLS load balancer and not expose port 8448 at all.  In this situation, Synapse will need to be configured to share the same <em>public</em> TLS certificate as the load balancer (as Synapse uses the public certificate for identity in other areas too, and it has to match the certificate that other servers see when they connect).</p>

identity servers are 100% decentralised and can openly federate with
each other. <strong>N.B. that you can use Matrix without ever using the
identity service - it exists only to map 3rd party IDs (e.g. email

<h3>What is the difference between Matrix and IRC?</h3>
<p>We love IRC. In fact, prior to the point where Riot was stable enough for daily use IRC was
our primary communication tool. Between us we've written IRCds, IRC bots
and admined dreamforge, UnrealIRCd, epona, ircservices and several
others.  That said, it has some limitations that Matrix seeks to improve
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text only</li>
<li>No history</li>
<li>No multiple-device support</li>
<li>No presence support</li>
<li>Fragmented identity model</li>
<li class="definition">No open [federation]</li>
<li>No standard APIs, just a rather limited TCP line protocol</li>
<li>Non-standardised federation protocol</li>
<li>No built-in end-to-end encryption</li>
<li>Disruptive net-splits</li>
<li>Non-extensible</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://ircv3.net">IRCv3</a> exists and is addressing some of these issues;
this is great news and we wish them well.  It's almost a contradiction
in terms to get competitive between openly interoperable communication

<h3>What is the difference between Matrix and XMPP?</h3>
<p>We think of Matrix and XMPP as being quite different; at its core
Matrix can be thought of as an eventually consistent global JSON db with
an HTTP API and pubsub semantics - whilst XMPP can be thought of as a
message passing protocol. You can use them both to build chat systems;
you can use them both to build pubsub systems; each comes with different
tradeoffs. Matrix has a deliberately extensive 'kitchen sink' baseline
of functionality; XMPP has a deliberately minimal baseline set of
functionality. If XMPP does what you need it to do, then we're genuinely
happy for you :) Meanwhile, rather than competing, an XMPP Bridge like
<a href="https://github.com/SkaveRat/xmpptrix">Skaverat's xmpptrix beta</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jfrederickson/matrix-xmpp-bridge">jfred's matrix-xmpp-bridge</a>
or Matrix.org's own <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/purple-matrix/">purple-matrix</a>
has potential to let both environments coexist and make the most of each
other's benefits.</p>
<p>TODO: above is good, the below is in a strange voice, assertive but then has equivocations in italics. Need opinions</p>
<p>The Matrix team used XMPP (Openfire, ejabberd, spectrum, asmack,
XMPPFramework) for IM before starting to experiment with open HTTP APIs
as an alternative in around 2012.  The main issues with XMPP that
drove us in this direction <strong>as of 2012</strong> were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not particularly web-friendly - you can't easily speak XMPP from a
web browser. <em>N.B. Nowadays you have options like XMPP-FTW and
Stanza.io that help loads with letting browsers talk XMPP</em></li>
<li>Single logical server per MUC is a single point of control and
availability. <em>MUCs can be distributed over multiple physical
servers, but they still sit behind a single logical JID and domain.
FMUC improves this with a similar approach to Matrix, but as of Oct
2015 there are no open source implementations. The MIX XMPP extension
also aims to address this limitation</em>.</li>
<li>History synchronisation is very much a second class citizen feature</li>
<li>Bridging to other protocols and defragmenting existing communication
apps and networks is very much a second class citizen feature</li>
<li>Stanzas aren't framed or reliably delivered without extensions. <em>See
<a href="http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Myths#Myth_Four:_XMPP_is_unreliable_without_a_bunch_of_extensions.">wiki.xmpp.org</a>
for an XMPP take on this</em></li>
<li>Multiple device support is limited. <em>Carbons and MAM aim to resolve this</em></li>
<li>Baseline feature set is so minimal that fragmentation of features
between clients and servers is common, especially as interoperability
profiles for features have fallen behind (as of July 2015)</li>
<li>No strong identity system (i.e. no standard E2E PKI, unless you
count X.509 certs, which <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/">are
questionable</a>)</li>
<li>Not particularly well designed for mobile use cases: push;
bandwidth-efficient transports. <em>Since the time of writing a <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html">Push
XEP has appeared</a>, and
<a href="http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Myths#Myth_Three:_It.27s_too_bandwidth-inefficient_for_mobile.">wiki.xmpp.org</a>
states that XMPP is usable over a 9600bps + 30s latency link.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This said, the whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective.
Rather than fighting over which open interoperable communication
standard works the best, we should just collaborate and bridge everything
together.  The more federation and interoperability the better.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between Matrix and PSYC?</h3>
<p>TODO: wtf is PSYC? do we need to include this?</p>
<p>PSYC is a open federated messaging protocol loosely inspired by IRC.  In
version 1 it was a standalone protocol, and in version 2 it is being
reutilised as a messaging layer on top of GNUnet.  We honestly don't
know that much about it, beyond trying to use psycd as an XMPP&lt;-&gt;IRC
bridge in 2010. Matrix differentiates primarily by providing simple HTTP
APIs rather than the more exotic compact line protocol in PSYC v1 or the
comprehensive GNUnet stack in v2, and Matrix focuses more on decentralised
conversation history rather than just decentralised chat servers.
On the other hand, Matrix doesn't provide the metadata protection
guarantees that GNUnet/PSYC aims for.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between Matrix and Tox?</h3>
<p>TODO Do we need to include this?</p>
<p>Tox.chat looks to be a very cool clone of Skype - a fully decentralised
peer-to-peer network.  Matrix is deliberately not a 'pure' peer-to-peer
system; instead each user has a well-defined homeserver which stores
his data and that he can depend upon.  Matrix provides HTTP APIs;
Tox.chat provides C APIs.  As of October 2015 Tox doesn't seem to have an
answer yet for decentralised conversation history storage.</p>

<h3>How does Matrix compare with something like Trillian or Pidgin?</h3>
<p>Trillian and Pidgin and similar aggregating IM clients merge all your IM
activity into a single app.  However, your history and
identity is still fragmented across the networks.  People can't find you
easily, and your history is fragmented (other than on the device
where the client runs).   And rather than being able to chose the right
app for the job when communicating with people, you are pushed towards
relying on a specific aggregation app.</p>
<p>Matrix lets you get the best of both worlds by linking to all the
different networks (XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Lync, Skype etc) on the serverside,
using bridges which can be run by anyone.  Matrix then provides a simple
standard HTTP API to access any of these networks, and lets you choose
whichever client you prefer (either as a 'native' Matrix client or using
a non-Matrix client from one of the networks which has been bridged in).</p>

<h3>What is an identity server?</h3>
<p>Users in Matrix are identified internally via their [matrix user ID (MXID)][MXID]{.definition}. However, existing 3rd party ID (3PID) namespaces such as email addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify Matrix users, at least for invitation purposes.  A Matrix &quot;Identity&quot; describes both the user ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their account.</p>
<p>Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, a globally federated cluster of trusted &quot;Identity Servers&quot; (IS) are used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings.
Usage of an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.</p>
<p>The precise architecture of identity servers is currently in flux and subject to change as we work to fully decentralise them.</p>

<p>Since events are extensible it is possible for malicious users and/or servers to add keys that are, for example offensive or illegal.
