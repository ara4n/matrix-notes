<h3 id="what-is-matrix%3F">What is Matrix? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-matrix%3F" aria-hidden="true">¶</a></h3>
<p>Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.</p>
<p>Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">Client</a>s, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.</p>
<div class='definition-list'>
<div class='definition-item definition-client'>
<p><strong>client</strong></p>
<p>Users in Matrix use one or more clients to communicate. This could be any combination of a web client, a command line client, a mobile client - or embedded clients built into existing apps. It could even be a piece of hardware (e.g. a drone) that is Matrix enabled.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-matrix's-mission%3F">What is Matrix's Mission? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-matrix's-mission%3F" aria-hidden="true">¶</a></h3>
<p>Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.</p>
<p>The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.</p>

<p>The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">client</a> app &amp; server you chose, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.</p>

<p>For the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core
contributors worked for <a href="https://www.amdocs.com">Amdocs</a>, who paid for them to
work fulltime on Matrix.  In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be
sufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.
The majority of the core team is now employed by <a href="#definition-newvector" class="definition">New Vector</a>, an independent company
set up to hire the team and support Matrix's development.  Other contributors
are funded by their own employers or donate their own time to the project.</p>

<p>We believe that any open standard defining interoperable communication needs to be justified, demonstrated and validated with transparent open source implementations. For Matrix to achieve its mission of making all communications services <a href="#definition-interoperable" class="definition">interoperable</a> we believe it needs to be truly open, giving people access to take all the code we produce and to use and build on top of it.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open standard, meaning that we have freely published the

HTTP APIs.  We encourage anyone and everyone to use the APIs and build
their own projects which implement them and so benefit from
interoperability with the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  We also
ensure the standard is not encumbered by any known patent licensing
requirements.</p>
<p>Matrix is also open source, meaning that we have released the source
code of the reference servers, clients and services to the public domain
under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Licence v2</a>, to
encourage anyone and everyone to run their own servers and clients, and

<h3 id="what-does-federated-mean%3F">What does federated mean? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-federated-mean%3F" aria-hidden="true">¶</a></h3>
<p>Federation allows separate deployments of a communication service to
communicate with each other - for instance a mail server run by Google
federates with a mail server run by Microsoft when you send email from
@gmail.com to @hotmail.com.</p>
<p><a href="#definition-federation" class="definition">Federation</a> is different to interoperability, as <a href="#definition-interoperable" class="definition">interoperable</a> clients
may simply be running on the same deployment - whereas in federation the
deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible manner.</p>
<p>Matrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the internet
can join into the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their own server.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_email">History of email</a> is instructive when thinking about the importance of [interoperability]{.definition}.</p>
<p>Early email systems behaved as isolated communities which only allowed
you to exchange mail with users on the same system.  If you got your
email from one service and your friend from another, then you couldn't
message each other.  This is basically the situation we're in today with
VoIP and IM.</p>

<p>The <a href="#definition-f-droid" class="definition">F-Droid</a> release of Riot does not use <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/">Google Cloud Messaging</a>. This allows users that do not have or want Google Services installed to use Riot.</p>
<p>The drawback is that Riot has to pull for new messages, which can drain your battery. To counter this, you can change the delay between polls in the settings. Higher delay means better battery life (but may delay receiving messages). You can also disable the background sync entirely (which means that you won't get any notifications at all).</p>
<p>If you don't mind using Google Services, you might be better off installing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.alpha">Google Play store</a> version.</p>

<p>HTTP may not be the most efficient transport, but it is ubiquitous, very well understood and has numerous implementations on almost every platform and language. It also has a simple upgrade path to HTTP/2, which is relatively bandwidth and round-trip efficient.</p>
<p>For these reasons it has been chosen as the mandatory baseline of the exchange, but it is still entirely possible to use other protocols for communication between clients and server (see for example this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1148">websocket transport spec proposal</a>), and it's also possible in the future that negotiation of more efficient protocols will be added for the <a href="#definition-federation" class="definition">federation</a> between servers, with HTTP+JSON remaining as the compatibility baseline.</p>

<p>We recommend servers use port 8448 for server&lt;-&gt;server HTTPS traffic.  Look at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse#setting-up-federation">&quot;Setting up Federation&quot;</a> in the Synapse readme file for details.</p>
<p>TODO: I don't fully understand the rest of this section</p>
<p>Client&lt;-&gt;Server traffic can talk directly to Synapse via port 8448, but as by default Synapse creates a self-signed TLS certificate this can cause problems for clients which can't easily trust self-signed certificates (e.g. most web browsers).  Instead, you can proxy access to Synapse's HTTP listener on port 8008 via an existing HTTPS proxy with a valid certificate (e.g. an nginx listening on port 443), or you can point Synapse at a valid X.509 signed TLS certificate.  In future, Synapse will probably use letsencrypt to autogenerate valid certificates rather than self-signed ones during installation, simplifying this process enormously.</p>
<p>You can also put Synapse entirely behind an existing TLS load balancer and not expose port 8448 at all.  In this situation, Synapse will need to be configured to share the same <em>public</em> TLS certificate as the load balancer (as Synapse uses the public certificate for identity in other areas too, and it has to match the certificate that other servers see when they connect).</p>

<p>Yes - the reference implementation is

<p>If you want your server to participate in the global replicated Matrix ID
service then please get in touch with us. Meanwhile, we are looking at
ways of decentralising the 'official' Matrix identity service so that
identity servers are 100% decentralised and can openly federate with
each other. <strong>N.B. that you can use Matrix without ever using the
identity service - it exists only to map 3rd party IDs (e.g. email

you can use them both to build pubsub systems; each comes with different
tradeoffs. Matrix has a deliberately extensive 'kitchen sink' baseline
of functionality; XMPP has a deliberately minimal baseline set of
functionality. If XMPP does what you need it to do, then we're genuinely
happy for you! Meanwhile, rather than competing, an XMPP Bridge like
<a href="https://github.com/SkaveRat/xmpptrix">Skaverat's xmpptrix beta</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jfrederickson/matrix-xmpp-bridge">jfred's matrix-xmpp-bridge</a>
or Matrix.org's own <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/purple-matrix/">purple-matrix</a>
has potential to let both environments coexist and make the most of each
other's benefits.</p>
<p>The whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective.
Rather than fighting over which open interoperable communication
standard works the best, we should just collaborate and bridge everything
together.  The more federation and interoperability the better.</p>

<p>Trillian and Pidgin and similar aggregating IM clients merge all your IM
activity into a single app.  However, your history and
identity is still fragmented across the networks.  People can't find you
easily, and your history is fragmented (other than on the device
where the client runs).   And rather than being able to chose the right
app for the job when communicating with people, you are pushed towards
relying on a specific aggregation app.</p>
<p>Matrix lets you get the best of both worlds by linking to all the
different networks (XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Lync, Skype etc) on the serverside,
using bridges which can be run by anyone.  Matrix then provides a simple
standard HTTP API to access any of these networks, and lets you choose
whichever client you prefer (either as a 'native' Matrix client or using
a non-Matrix client from one of the networks which has been bridged in).</p>

<p>Users in Matrix are identified internally via their <a href="#definition-mxid" class="definition">matrix user ID (MXID)</a>. However, existing 3rd party ID (3PID) namespaces such as email addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify Matrix users, at least for invitation purposes.  A Matrix &quot;Identity&quot; describes both the user ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their account.</p>
<p>Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, a globally federated cluster of trusted &quot;Identity Servers&quot; (IS) are used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings.
Usage of an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.</p>
<p>The precise architecture of identity servers is currently in flux and subject to change as we work to fully decentralise them.</p>

<p>Since events are extensible it is possible for malicious users and/or servers to add keys that are, for example offensive or illegal. Since some events cannot be simply deleted (e.g. membership events) we instead 'redact' events, essentially stripping the event of all keys that are not required by the protocol. Redacting an event cannot be undone, allowing server owners to also delete the offending content from the databases.</p>
