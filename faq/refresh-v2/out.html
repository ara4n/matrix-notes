<div class='question'>
<h3>What is Matrix?</h3>
<p>Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.</p>
<p>Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">Client</a>s, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.</p>

<div class='question'>
<h3>What is Matrix's Mission?</h3>
<p>Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.</p>
<p>The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.</p>

</div>
<div class='question'>
<h3>What does this mean for users?</h3>
<p>The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">client</a> app &amp; server you chose, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.</p>

<h2>Who and How</h2>
<div class='question'>
<h3>What kind of company is Matrix.org?</h3>
<p>Matrix.org is an open initiative which acts as a neutral and independent custodian of the Matrix standard. As of Sept 2017 we are finally in the process of incorporating it as a dedicated non-profit entity (most likely a limited by guarantee UK private company called the Matrix.org Foundation).</p>

<h3>How is Matrix.org funded?</h3>
<p>TODO: rewrite to include Status.im.</p>
<p>Matrix.org is currently (Sept 2017) funded by the community, through a
combination of community support (via
<a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>,
<a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a>, Bitcoin and Ethereum),
corporate sponsorship, and grant funding.</p>
<p>Below is ok.</p>
<p>Current Elliptic-level supporters on
Patreon and corporate sponsors can be found on our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/supporters">supporters
page</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to support the core Matrix team as a member of the community, you can do so via:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a></li>
<li>Bitcoin (address: 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE)</li>
<li>Ethereum (address: 0xA5f9a4f9E024F6D727f7afdA9257e22329A97485)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to sponsor the
team as a corporation, or are interested in paying for prioritised or custom
development, please <a href="mailto:matthew@matrix.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>For the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core
contributors worked for <a href="https://www.amdocs.com">Amdocs</a>, who paid for them to
work fulltime on Matrix.  In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be
sufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.
The majority of the core team is now employed by [New Vector]{.definition}, an independent company
set up to hire the team and support Matrix's development.  Other contributors
are funded by their own employers or donate their own time to the project.</p>

<h3>Who is building Matrix?</h3>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<div class='question'>
<h3>Why have you released this as open source?</h3>
<p>We believe that any open standard defining interoperable communication needs to be justified, demonstrated and validated with transparent open source implementations. For Matrix to achieve its mission of making all communications services [interoperable]{.definition} we believe it needs to be truly open, giving people access to take all the code we produce and to use and build on top of it.</p>

</div>
<div class='question'>
<h3>What do you mean by open?</h3>
<p>Matrix is an open standard, meaning that we have freely published the
details for how to communicate [interoperably][interoperable]{.definition} using the Matrix set of
HTTP APIs.  We encourage anyone and everyone to use the APIs and build
their own projects which implement them and so benefit from
interoperability with the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  We also
ensure the standard is not encumbered by any known patent licensing
requirements.</p>
<p>Matrix is also open source, meaning that we have released the source
code of the reference servers, clients and services to the public domain
under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Licence v2</a>, to
encourage anyone and everyone to run their own servers and clients, and
enhance them and contribute their enhancements as they see fit.</p>

<h3>What does federated mean?</h3>
<p>Federation allows separate deployments of a communication service to
communicate with each other - for instance a mail server run by Google
federates with a mail server run by Microsoft when you send email from
@gmail.com to @hotmail.com.</p>
<p>[Federation]{.definition} is different to interoperability, as [interoperable]{.definition} clients
may simply be running on the same deployment - whereas in federation the
deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible manner.</p>
<p>Matrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the internet
can join into the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their own server.</p>

<h3>How is this like e-mail?</h3>
<p>When email was first set up in the early ‘80s, companies like Compuserve
and AT&amp;T and Sprint set up isolated email communities which only allowed
you to exchange mail with users on the same system.  If you got your
email from one service and your friend from another, then you couldn't
message each other.  This is basically the situation we're in today with
VoIP and IM.</p>

<h3>Why has no one done this before?</h3>
<p>There have been several attempts before including [SIP]{.definition}, [XMPP]{.definition} and [RCS]{.definition}.</p>
<p>All of these have had some level of success, but many different
technological/usability/economic factors have ended up limiting their
success.  Unfortunately, we've not ended up in a world where everyone
has a SIP URI or Jabber ID on their business card, or a phone that
actually uses RCS.</p>

<h2>Practical</h2>
<div class='question'>
<h3>What can I actually do with this?</h3>
<p>A typical <a href="#definition-client" class="definition">client</a> provides a simple chatroom interface to Matrix -
letting the user interact with users and rooms anywhere within the
Matrix [federation]{.definition}.  Text and image messages are supported, and basic
voice-only VoIP calling via WebRTC is supported in one-to-one rooms.
(As of October 2015, experimental multi-way calling is also available
on Riot.im).</p>

<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
<p>Come say hi on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!  Install [synapse]{.defintion} and tell us how you get on. Critique [the spec].  Write <a href="#definition-client" class="defintion">clients</a>.  Write bridges!  Run bridges!  Nose around in the repositories in our
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org">GitHub organization</a> and send us some pull requests
to fix some bugs or add some features!  You could even try to write a homeserver
(but be warned, Matrix's architecture makes homeservers orders of magnitude harder
than clients or bridges.)</p>
<p>See <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst">CONTRIBUTING.rst</a> for
full details on how to contribute to the project.  All are welcome!</p>

<h3>I installed Riot via F-Droid, why is it draining my battery?</h3>
<p>The [F-Droid]{.definition} release of Riot does not use <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/">Google Cloud Messaging</a>. This allows users that do not have or want Google Services installed to use Riot.</p>
<p>The drawback is that Riot has to pull for new messages, which can drain your battery. To counter this, you can change the delay between polls in the settings. Higher delay means better battery life (but may delay receiving messages). You can also disable the background sync entirely (which means that you won't get any notifications at all).</p>
<p>If you don't mind using Google Services, you might be better off installing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.alpha">Google Play store</a> version.</p>
