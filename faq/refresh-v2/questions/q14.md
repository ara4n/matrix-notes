### What is the difference between Matrix and IRC?

We love IRC. In fact, prior to the point where Riot was stable enough for daily use IRC was
our primary communication tool. Between us we've written IRCds, IRC bots
and admined dreamforge, UnrealIRCd, epona, ircservices and several
others.  That said, it has some limitations that Matrix seeks to improve
on:

- Text only
- No history
- No multiple-device support
- No presence support
- Fragmented identity model
- No open [federation]{.definition}
- No standard APIs, just a rather limited TCP line protocol
- Non-standardised federation protocol
- No built-in end-to-end encryption
- Disruptive net-splits
- Non-extensible

[IRCv3](http://ircv3.net) exists and is addressing some of these issues;
this is great news and we wish them well.  It's almost a contradiction
in terms to get competitive between openly interoperable communication
projects - we look forward to increasing the richness of Matrix\<-\>IRC
bridges as the project progresses.
