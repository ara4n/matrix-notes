### What is the status of E2E?

End-to-End Encryption is currently in late beta. Rooms can have encryption enabled, but it is not by default.

Regarding client support, [Riot]{.definition} and [Nheko]{.definition} each currently support E2E end.

As of July 2018, work is progressing to add E2E support in the [matrix-python-sdk].
