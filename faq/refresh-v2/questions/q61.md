### Where can I find a web app?

You can use [Riot.im](https://riot.im/app/) - a glossy web client written on top of [matrix-react-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk).

You can also host Riot on your own server. It's a static web application, just download the [last release](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/) and unpack it.
