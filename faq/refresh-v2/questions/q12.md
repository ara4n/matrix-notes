### How is this like e-mail?

When email was first set up in the early ‘80s, companies like Compuserve
and AT&T and Sprint set up isolated email communities which only allowed
you to exchange mail with users on the same system.  If you got your
email from one service and your friend from another, then you couldn't
message each other.  This is basically the situation we're in today with
VoIP and IM.

TODO : how was the problem solved for email? how does this relate to federation?
