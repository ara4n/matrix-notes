### Where can I find a desktop client?

You can use the desktop build of [Riot.im](https://riot.im/desktop.html). 

There are also other desktop clients - check the list of clients on [matrix.org](http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#clients).

TODO: update this list with concrete examples
