### How can I get involved?

Come say hi on [\#matrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org)!  Install [synapse]{.definition} and tell us how you get on. Critique [the spec]. Â Write [clients][client]{.definition}.  Write bridges!  Run bridges!  Nose around in the repositories in our
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/matrix-org) and send us some pull requests
to fix some bugs or add some features!  You could even try to write a homeserver
(but be warned, Matrix's architecture makes homeservers orders of magnitude harder
than clients or bridges.) See [CONTRIBUTING.rst](http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) for
full details on how to contribute to the project.  All are welcome!
