### What bridges to other networks are available?

There are a large number of '[bridges]{.definition}' which integrate existing communication networks into
Matrix. This list is growing rapidly, and you can find bridges both written by the Matrix core team
and contributed by the wider community.  The full list can be seen at
[https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now](https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now), but the core ones as of Oct 2015 include:

Writing new bridges is incredibly fun and easy - see the [matrix-appservice-bridge HOWTO](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/HOWTO.md)
for an example of how to write a fully functional Slack bridge in less than 100 lines of code!
