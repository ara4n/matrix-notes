### Can I write a Matrix homeserver?

Yes. Matrix is just a spec, and implementations of the spec are very welcome!

The most well-distributed [homeserver]{.definition} in the wild today is [Synapse]{.definition}. Writing a Matrix homeserver is a different and larger challenge than writing a [bot]{.definition} or a [client]{.definition}, but  other projects aiming to implement the server component include:

* [Dendrite]
* [Ruma]
* [The Construct]
* [Plasma]
* [jeon](https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon)
* mxhsd (TODO still wants to be included?)

The [S2S] spec is still being finalised for r0, so if you are planning on doing work in this area, come chat to us in [#matrix-dev:matrix.org]. You can also read about the [Federation API here](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html).
