### Can I write a Matrix homeserver?

Yes. Matrix is just a spec, and implementations of the spec are very welcome! 

The most well-distributed [homeserver] in the wild today is [Synapse], but other projects aiming to implement the server component include:

* Dendrite
* Ruma
* The Construct
* mxhsd (still wants to be included?)
* Plasma
* ma1uta?

The [S2S] spec is still being finalised for r0, so if you are planning on doing work in this area, come chat to us in [#matrix-dev:matrix.org]. You can also read about the [Federation API here](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html).
