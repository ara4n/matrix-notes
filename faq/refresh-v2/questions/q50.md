### How do I join the global Matrix federation?

You can [choose a client](#matrix-compliant-apps) and create a user account on an existing homeserver.

To host your own homeserver you can download and run one of the available Matrix servers - please see [this guide](http://matrix.org/docs/guides/getting_involved.html#run) for details!
