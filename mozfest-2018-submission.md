## Name

Let's make a chatbot using Matrix

## What will happen in your session? (120)

A somewhat-on-rails workshop in which participants will build a basic chatbot implemented as a Matrix bot using the Matrix Client-Server S API. The IO components should be finished in a few minutes, allowing the bulk of the session to focus on other more exciting (even non-Matrix) parts.

## What is the goal or outcome of your session? (120)

Use the CS API to build a bot. The common theme is that this bot will communicate with Matrix, which means it can communicate with any bridged platform. Participants will see how easy it is to add additional features to their bot and will understand why a self-hosted, optionally federated platform provides an advantage.

## After the festival, how will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward? (120)

Participants will be able to engage with the very-active Matrix community and ecosystem! They will also have gained some knowledge of chatbot design principals, knowledge of the CS API and why HTTP and JSON are so powerful.

## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3? (120)

We may demand a basic level of understanding of web/programming platform of some kind and of HTTP. However, by optionally staying on a pre-chosen development path (even having checkpoints available), people should not fall behind.
