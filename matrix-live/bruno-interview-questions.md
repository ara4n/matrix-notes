## Setup

* Who are you?
* riot-web is purely client side, it does not run on the server, meaning calls to your homeserver are made direct from the browser... is that right?
* What is the relationship between js-sdk, react-sdk, riot-web

## Goals & non-Goals

* What is the final aim of this project? To match the designs shared in May?
* The redesign is being implemented as a theme? Does this mean the changes are purely UX?
  * What are themes, in riot-web?

## Design

* Looks modern, also looks a little like Slack.

## Status

* What is the current progress?
  * As a %?
  * Which parts are done?
  * Which are not done?
* Would you recommend people use it yet?
  * What can they expect?

## After

* What are the next steps for riot-web?
* Does the work you are doing now contribute to that?
